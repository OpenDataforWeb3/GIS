Graph based Identification of Sybils

Much more about our intended approach can be found at in this write-up: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aliAgjct6dZ5ZZdBEwbykJJRgxyMhx_d8Bd99WKLJAg/edit?usp=sharing

And this is a useful survey of the domain:  https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1812/1812.08434.pdf

As compared to that diagram, we ALSO want to employ transfer learning to create a foundation-like model that can then be fine-tuned as needed.  The foundation model should have extremely expressive embeddings so that it best informs the pattern or motif final model.

Regarding which model or approach to select for our large heterogeneous directed temporal graph, the following graphic may be of some use.
